# 📡 Digital Signal Encoder and Visualizer

This Java application provides a graphical user interface for encoding and visualizing digital signals using various line coding techniques.

## ✨ Features

- Supports multiple encoding techniques:
  - 🔵 Unipolar NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero)
  - 🔴 Polar NRZ
  - 🟣 Polar NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted)
  - 🟢 Manchester encoding
  - 🟠 Differential Manchester encoding
- 📊 Real-time visualization of encoded signals
- 🖥️ Interactive GUI for input and encoding selection
- 📏 Clear signal representation with axes and grid lines
